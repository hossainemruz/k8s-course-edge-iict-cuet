# Session 5: Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

In this session, we will learn how we can control access of Kubernetes resources.

**Theory:**

- Introduction to Persistent Volume
- Introduction to StatefulSet
- Introduction to ConfigMap and Secrets

**Hands On:**

- Deploying sample app without persistent volume
- Creating a Persistent Volume
- Deploy sample application with persistent volume
- Deploy a database with StatefulSet
- Pass configuration to application using ConfigMap
- Pass sensitive information to a application using Secret
